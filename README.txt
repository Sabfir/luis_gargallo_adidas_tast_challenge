Hello, I wanted to leave this message explaining how I developed the exercise. Firstly as a database, I used h2 in memory, which allowed me a 
greater ease to work with the data. I have 
also configured 2 users with Spring security:

- admin : password
- user : password

You can aslo find the Dockerfile in the main directory of the project.

I hope you will excuse my possible 
failures since I had not had the opportunity 
to work with REST services, only a small approximation 
of how they work and develop.

Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to show you my knowledge.
